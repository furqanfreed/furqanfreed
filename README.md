### Hey there 👋

Welcome! Here's a quick snapshot of what I'm up to:

- 🔭 **Current Stack:** Actively working with **Node.js**, **Laravel**, **Nuxt.js**, **React**, **Angular**, and **Vue.js** – yes, I like playing across the frontend and backend!
- 🛠️ **Into DevOps? So am I.** Over the past couple of years, I’ve been diving deep into **Docker**, **CI/CD pipelines**, **Jenkins**, and setting up robust architectures with **clusters**, **load balancers**, and more.
